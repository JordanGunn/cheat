# grep Command Cheat Sheet

# Basic grep Usage
# Search for a pattern within a file
grep 'pattern' filename

# Case Insensitive Search
# Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the input files
grep -i 'pattern' filename

# Recursive Search
# Recursively search for a pattern in all files under the specified directory
grep -r 'pattern' directory_path

# Search with Line Numbers
# Print the line number for each matched line
grep -n 'pattern' filename

# Search for Whole Words
# Only match lines containing matches that form whole words
grep -w 'pattern' filename

# Invert Match
# Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines
grep -v 'pattern' filename

# Match Count
# Print only a count of matching lines for each input file
grep -c 'pattern' filename

# Show Lines Before/After/Context
# -B: Show num lines before the match
# -A: Show num lines after the match
# -C: Show num lines before and after the match
grep -B num 'pattern' filename
grep -A num 'pattern' filename
grep -C num 'pattern' filename

# Regular Expressions
# Use regular expressions for pattern matching

# ^: Matches the start of the line
grep '^pattern' filename

# $: Matches the end of the line
grep 'pattern$' filename

# .: Matches any single character
grep 'p.tt.rn' filename

# *: Matches zero or more occurrences of the previous character
grep 'pat*ern' filename

# []: Matches any one of the enclosed characters
grep 'patt[aeiou]rn' filename

# {}: Matches a specified number of occurrences of the previous character
grep 'pat{2}ern' filename

# Extended Regular Expressions
# Use extended regular expressions (ERE)
grep -E 'pat+ern' filename

# OR Operator
# Match lines containing either of the patterns
grep 'pattern1\|pattern2' filename
# or using ERE
grep -E 'pattern1|pattern2' filename

# Grouping
# Group parts of the pattern
grep -E '(pattern1|pattern2)pattern3' filename

# Escape Special Characters
# Use a backslash to escape special characters
grep 'pattern\*' filename

# Notes:
# - grep is case sensitive by default.
# - Regular expressions in grep are powerful for complex pattern matching.
# - Use single quotes around the pattern to avoid shell interpretation.
# - grep can be combined with other commands using pipes for more complex searches.

# This is a basic overview of the grep command. For more detailed information, consult the grep man page (man grep).
