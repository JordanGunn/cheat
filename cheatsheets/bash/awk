# awk Cheat Sheet

# Basic Usage
# Print the entire line from the file
awk '{print}' filename

# Field Access
# Print specific fields (default field separator is whitespace)
awk '{print $1, $3}' filename  # Prints first and third fields of each line

# Custom Field Separator
# Specify a field separator using -F flag
awk -F':' '{print $1}' filename  # Use ':' as field separator

# Pattern Matching
# Print lines that match a pattern
awk '/pattern/ {print}' filename

# Conditional Statements
# Apply condition to perform actions
awk '$1 > 100 {print $1}' filename  # Print first field if it's greater than 100

# Built-in Variables
# NR: Number of Records (lines)
# NF: Number of Fields in current record
# FILENAME: Current filename
awk '{print NR, $1}' filename  # Print line number and first field

# Multiple Commands
# Separate multiple commands with a semicolon
awk '{sum += $1; count++} END {print "Average:", sum/count}' filename

# BEGIN and END Blocks
# Execute actions before and after processing the file
awk 'BEGIN {print "Start"} {print} END {print "End"}' filename

# Arrays
# Use arrays for more complex data manipulation
awk '{arr[$1] += $2} END {for (i in arr) print i, arr[i]}' filename

# String Functions
# substr, length, index, match, gsub, sub, split
awk '{print substr($1, 1, 3)}' filename  # Print first 3 characters of the first field

# Regular Expressions
# Use regular expressions for pattern matching
awk '$1 ~ /pattern/ {print}' filename  # Print if first field matches 'pattern'

# Redirect Output
# Redirect output to a file
awk '{print > "output.txt"}' filename

# Passing External Variables
# Pass external variables to awk
variable="value"
awk -v var="$variable" '{print var, $1}' filename

# Notes:
# - awk is line-oriented and processes one line at a time.
# - Fields are accessed using the $ sign and a number (e.g., $1 for the first field).
# - awk is powerful for text processing and data extraction tasks.

# This is a basic overview of the awk command. For more detailed information, consult the awk man page (man awk) or online resources.
